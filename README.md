A food dish prediction system utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify the dish name from images provided by users. This technology leverages image recognition techniques to analyze visual features of the food items captured in the images and match them with a database of known dishes. By training the machine learning model on a large dataset of food images, it learns to accurately classify and predict the names of various dishes based on their visual characteristics. Users can simply upload a photo of their food, and the system will quickly identify and display the corresponding dish name, enhancing user experience and convenience in food identification and discovery.
